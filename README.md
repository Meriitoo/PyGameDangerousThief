Pygame-based game customization projects, focusing on game design and mechanics. 
One notable project features a thrilling game where players assume the role of a cunning thief stealing various currencies, including euros and dollars.
The game offers two challenging levels: "Easy" and "Hard." In the "Hard" level, the speed at which money appears increases, adding an extra layer of difficulty for players seeking a greater challenge.
Additionally, as players reach specific score milestones, their character undergoes a transformation, evolving into a new form.
The goal is to accumulate wealth while navigating obstacles that represent the risks of international heists.
Failure results in capture and imprisonment, adding a captivating narrative layer.
